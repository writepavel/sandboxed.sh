//! Agents module - task execution system.
//!
//! # Agent Types
//! - **SimpleAgent**: Unified agent that directly executes tasks
//! - **TaskExecutor**: Core execution loop with tools (used by SimpleAgent)
//!
//! # Legacy Types (deprecated, will be removed)
//! - **RootAgent**: Complex orchestrator (replaced by SimpleAgent)
//! - **NodeAgent**: Recursive splitter (removed - lost context)
//! - **ComplexityEstimator**: LLM-based estimation (unreliable)
//! - **ModelSelector**: U-curve optimization (over-engineered)
//! - **Verifier**: LLM self-verification (rubber-stamped everything)
//!
//! # Design Principles
//! - Direct execution without orchestration overhead
//! - User controls task granularity (no auto-splitting)
//! - Blocker detection via system prompt rules
//! - Mission completion via complete_mission tool
