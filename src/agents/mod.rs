//! Agents module - task execution system.
//!
//! # Agent Types
//! - **OpenCodeAgent**: Delegates task execution to an OpenCode server (Claude Max)
//!
//! # Design Principles
//! - OpenCode handles all task execution
//! - Real-time event streaming (thinking, tool calls, results)
//! - Integration with Claude Max subscriptions
