# Open Agent – Project Guide

Open Agent is a managed control plane for OpenCode-based agents. The backend **does not** run model inference or autonomous logic; it delegates execution to an OpenCode server and focuses on orchestration, telemetry, and workspace/library management.

## Architecture Summary

- **Backend (Rust/Axum)**: mission orchestration, workspace/container management, MCP registry, Library sync.
- **OpenCode Client**: `src/opencode/` and `src/agents/opencode.rs` (thin wrapper).
- **Dashboards**: `dashboard/` (Next.js) and `ios_dashboard/` (SwiftUI).

## Core Concepts

- **Library**: Git-backed config repo (skills, commands, agents, tools, rules, MCPs). `src/library/`. The default template is at [github.com/Th0rgal/openagent-library-template](https://github.com/Th0rgal/openagent-library-template).
- **Workspaces**: Host or container environments with their own skills, tools, and plugins. `src/workspace.rs` manages workspace lifecycle and syncs skills/tools to `.opencode/`.
- **Missions**: Agent selection + workspace + conversation. Execution is delegated to OpenCode and streamed to the UI.

## Scoping Model

- **Global**: Auth, providers, MCPs (run on HOST machine), agents, commands, rules
- **Per-Workspace**: Skills, tools, plugins/hooks, installed software (container only), file isolation
- **Per-Mission**: Agent selection, workspace selection, conversation history

MCPs can be global because and run as child processes on the host or workspace (run inside the container). It depends on the kind of MCP.

## Container Execution Model (Important!)

When a **mission runs in a container workspace**, bash commands execute **inside the container**, not on the host. Here's why:

1. OpenCode's built-in Bash tool is **disabled** for container workspaces
2. Agents use `workspace_bash` from the "workspace MCP" instead
3. The "workspace MCP" command is **wrapped in systemd-nspawn** at startup
4. Therefore all `workspace_bash` commands run inside the container with container networking

The "workspace MCP" is named this way because it runs in the **workspace's execution context** - for container workspaces, that means inside the container.

See `src/workspace.rs` lines 590-640 (nspawn wrapping) and 714-720 (tool configuration).

**Contrast with workspace exec API**: The `/api/workspaces/:id/exec` endpoint also runs commands inside containers (via nspawn), but is subject to HTTP timeouts. The mission system uses SSE streaming with no timeout.

## Design Guardrails

- Do **not** reintroduce autonomous agent logic (budgeting, task splitting, verification, model selection). OpenCode handles execution.
- Keep the backend a thin orchestrator: **Start Mission → Stream Events → Store Logs**.
- Avoid embedding provider-specific logic in the backend. Provider auth is managed via OpenCode config + dashboard flows.

## Timeout Philosophy

Open Agent is a **pure pass-through frontend** to OpenCode. We intentionally do NOT impose any timeouts on the SSE event stream from OpenCode. All timeout handling is delegated to OpenCode, which manages tool execution timeouts internally.

**Why no timeouts in Open Agent?**
- Long-running tools (vision analysis, large file operations, web scraping) should complete naturally
- Users can abort missions manually via the dashboard if needed
- Avoids artificial timeout mismatches between Open Agent and OpenCode
- OpenCode remains the single source of truth for execution limits

**What this means:**
- The SSE stream in `src/opencode/mod.rs` runs indefinitely until OpenCode sends a `MessageComplete` event or closes the connection
- The only timeout applied is for initial HTTP connection establishment (`DEFAULT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`)
- If a mission appears stuck, check OpenCode logs first—any timeout errors originate from OpenCode or downstream clients (like Conductor), not Open Agent

## Common Entry Points

- `src/api/routes.rs` – API routing and server startup.
- `src/api/control.rs` – mission control session, SSE streaming.
- `src/api/mission_runner.rs` – per-mission execution loop.
- `src/workspace.rs` – workspace lifecycle + OpenCode config generation.
- `src/opencode/` – OpenCode HTTP + SSE client.

## Local Dev

The backend must be deployed on a remote linux server and ran in debug mode (release is too slow).

```bash
# Backend (url is https://agent-backend.thomas.md but remote is 95.216.112.253)
export OPENCODE_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:4096"
cargo run --debug

# Dashboard
cd dashboard
bun install
bun dev
```

## Debugging Missions

Missions are persisted in a **SQLite database** with full event logging, enabling detailed post-mortem analysis.

**Database location**: `~/.openagent/missions/missions.db` (or `missions-dev.db` in dev mode)

**Retrieve events via API**:
```bash
GET /api/control/missions/{mission_id}/events
```

**Query parameters**:
- `types=<type1>,<type2>` – filter by event type
- `limit=<n>` – max events to return
- `offset=<n>` – pagination offset

**Event types captured**:
- `user_message` – user inputs
- `thinking` – agent reasoning tokens
- `tool_call` – tool invocations (name + input)
- `tool_result` – tool outputs
- `assistant_message` – agent responses
- `mission_status_changed` – status transitions
- `error` – execution errors

**Example**: Retrieve tool calls for a mission:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/control/missions/<mission_id>/events?types=tool_call,tool_result" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

**Code entry points**: `src/api/mission_store/` handles persistence; `src/api/control.rs` exposes the events endpoint.

## Dashboard Data Fetching (SWR)

The dashboard uses [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) for data fetching with stale-while-revalidate caching. This provides instant UI updates from cache while revalidating in the background.

### Common SWR Keys

Use consistent keys to enable cache sharing across components:

| Key | Fetcher | Used In |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `'stats'` | `getStats` | Overview page (3s polling) |
| `'workspaces'` | `listWorkspaces` | Overview, Workspaces page |
| `'missions'` | `listMissions` | Recent tasks sidebar, History page |
| `'workspace-templates'` | `listWorkspaceTemplates` | Workspaces page |
| `'library-skills'` | `listLibrarySkills` | Workspaces page |
| `'ai-providers'` | `listAIProviders` | Settings page |
| `'health'` | `getHealth` | Settings page |
| `'system-components'` | `getSystemComponents` | Server connection card |
| `'opencode-agents'` | `getVisibleAgents` | New mission dialog |
| `'openagent-config'` | `getOpenAgentConfig` | New mission dialog |
| `'tools'` | `listTools` | Tools page |

### Usage Patterns

**Basic fetch (no polling):**
```tsx
const { data, isLoading, error } = useSWR('workspaces', listWorkspaces, {
  revalidateOnFocus: false,
});
```

**With polling:**
```tsx
const { data } = useSWR('stats', getStats, {
  refreshInterval: 3000,
  revalidateOnFocus: false,
});
```

**After mutations (revalidate cache):**
```tsx
const { mutate } = useSWR('missions', listMissions);
// After deleting a mission:
await deleteMission(id);
mutate(); // Revalidates from server
```

**Optimistic updates:**
```tsx
mutate(missions.filter(m => m.id !== deletedId), false); // Update cache without revalidation
```

### Guidelines

- Always use `revalidateOnFocus: false` unless you need tab-focus refresh
- Use the same SWR key when multiple components need the same data
- Prefer `mutate()` after mutations instead of manual state updates
- SWR returns `undefined` (not `null`) when data hasn't loaded - use `?? null` or `?? []` as needed

## Production Deployment

For deploying Open Agent on a VPS or dedicated server, see **[INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md)**.

This covers:
- systemd services for OpenCode and Open Agent
- nginx/Caddy reverse proxy with SSL (Let's Encrypt)
- DNS setup and domain configuration
- Authentication configuration
- Library git repo setup

**If asked to deploy Open Agent**: Read INSTALL.md first. It contains an "AI Agents" section at the top listing prerequisites to collect from the user (server IP, domain, SSH access, Library repo URL).

### Build Mode

**IMPORTANT: Always use debug builds unless release is explicitly requested.**

Debug builds are preferred because:
- Much faster compilation time
- Better error messages and stack traces
- Release builds are unnecessarily slow for this use case

When deploying, use `cargo build` (not `cargo build --release`).

## Notes

- OpenCode config files are generated per workspace; do not keep static `opencode.json` in the repo.
- Container workspaces require root and Ubuntu/Debian tooling (systemd-nspawn).
