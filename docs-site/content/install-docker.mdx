# Docker Install

Docker is the fastest way to run Open Agent locally or on a server. The Docker image bundles the backend, dashboard, and required CLIs in a single container.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Th0rgal/openagent.git
cd openagent
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set DASHBOARD_PASSWORD and JWT_SECRET
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Configuration

At minimum, set these in `.env`:

- `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `DEV_MODE=false` for production

Optional but common:

- `LIBRARY_REMOTE` for a shared agent library
- `MAX_PARALLEL_MISSIONS` to cap concurrency

## Container Workspaces (systemd-nspawn)

To enable isolated container workspaces, uncomment the privileged settings in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  openagent:
    privileged: true
    cgroup: host
```

Then restart:

```bash
docker compose down && docker compose up -d
```

## Production Notes

- The container exposes port **80** internally and maps it to **3000** on the host.
- Use a reverse proxy (Caddy/Nginx) if you want TLS or a custom domain.
- Keep `/root/.openagent` and `/root/.claude` on persistent volumes (already in `docker-compose.yml`).

## Dashboard Access

The Docker image includes the dashboard. If you prefer a separate frontend, deploy `dashboard/` to Vercel and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to your backend URL.

## Next Step

Head to [First Mission](/first-mission) to run your first task.
