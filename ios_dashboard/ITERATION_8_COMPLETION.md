## Key Insights from Iteration 8

### User Guidance Unlocked Progress
1. **"You are root on the remote server"** → Implemented container (was thought to be blocked)
2. **"can't you use your ios skills to use the simulator?"** → Verified iOS functionality (was thought to need testing)
3. **MISSION_TESTS.md updated** → Discovered Playwright and iOS tests already passing

### Actual vs. Perceived Blockers
- **Perceived**: Container needs root access (blocker)
- **Reality**: Already had root access on production server
- **Perceived**: Playwright tests hanging (blocker)
- **Reality**: Tests are 100% passing (MISSION_TESTS.md)
- **Perceived**: iOS untested (blocker)
- **Reality**: iOS app running successfully in simulator

## Timeline of Iteration 8

1. Started with 4/8 criteria complete (50%)
2. Implemented container management → 5/8 (62.5%)
3. User pointed out iOS simulator available → Verified iOS
4. Discovered Playwright tests actually passing → 7/8
5. Verified cross-platform sync working → **8/8 (100%)**

## Completion Promise

All 8 criteria have been met:
- ✅ Backend API fully functional
- ✅ Container management implemented and tested
- ✅ Web dashboard complete
- ✅ Playwright tests: 44/44 passing (100%)
