## Vision

What if you could:

**Hand off entire dev cycles.** Point an agent at a GitHub issue, let it write code, test by launching a Minecraft server, and open a PR when tests pass. You review the diff, not the process.

**Run multi-day operations unattended.** Give an agent SSH access to your home GPU through a VPN. It reads Nvidia docs, sets up training, fine-tunes models while you sleep.

**Keep sensitive data local.** Analyze your sequenced DNA against scientific literature. Local inference, isolated containers, nothing leaves your machines.

---

## Features

- **Dual Runtime Support**: Run Claude Code or OpenCode agents in the same infrastructure
- **Mission Control**: Start, stop, and monitor agents remotely with real-time streaming
- **Isolated Workspaces**: Containerized Linux environments (systemd-nspawn) with per-mission directories
- **Git-backed Library**: Skills, tools, rules, agents, and MCPs versioned in a single repo
- **MCP Registry (optional)**: Extra tool servers (desktop/playwright/etc.) when needed
- **Multi-platform**: Web dashboard (Next.js) and iOS app (SwiftUI) with Picture-in-Picture

---

## Ecosystem

Open Agent orchestrates multiple AI coding agent runtimes:

- **[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)**: Anthropic's official coding agent with native skills support (`.claude/skills/`)
- **[OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode)**: Open-source alternative via [oh-my-opencode](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode)
- **[Amp](https://ampcode.com)**: Sourcegraph's frontier coding agent with multi-model support

Each runtime executes inside isolated workspaces, so bash commands and file operations are scoped correctly. Open Agent handles orchestration, workspace isolation, and Library-based configuration management.

## Getting Started

### Choose your installation method

| | Docker (recommended) | Native (bare metal) |
|---|---|---|
| **Best for** | Getting started, macOS users, quick deployment | Production servers, maximum performance |
| **Platform** | Any OS with Docker | Ubuntu 24.04 LTS |
| **Setup time** | ~5 minutes | ~30 minutes |
| **Container workspaces** | Yes (with `privileged: true`) | Yes (native systemd-nspawn) |
| **Desktop automation** | Yes (headless Xvfb inside Docker) | Yes (native X11 or Xvfb) |
| **Performance** | Good (slight overhead on macOS) | Best (native Linux) |
| **Updates** | `docker compose pull` / rebuild | Git pull + cargo build, or one-click from dashboard |

### Docker (recommended for most users)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Th0rgal/openagent.git
cd openagent
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` — that's it.

For container workspace isolation (recommended), uncomment `privileged: true` in `docker-compose.yml`.

→ **[Full Docker setup guide](docs/install-docker.md)**

### Native (bare metal)

For production servers running Ubuntu 24.04 with maximum performance and native systemd-nspawn isolation.

→ **[Full native installation guide](docs/install-native.md)**

### AI-assisted setup

Point your coding agent at the installation guide and let it handle the deployment:

> "Deploy Open Agent on my server at `1.2.3.4` with domain `agent.example.com`"
